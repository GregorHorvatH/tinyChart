# tinyChart
tinyChart.js is an open-source library (it's available on GitHub) that helps you easily visualize data using JavaScript.
It supports only responsive line chart for now.

Motivation to create this chart was data visualisation in ESP8266 web server with minimum memory usage on file storage.
